## Checkpoint 6: 🚢 Ship it! 🚁

📦 Run `yarn build` to package up your frontend.

💽 Upload your app to surge with `yarn surge` (you could also `yarn s3` or maybe even `yarn ipfs`?)

> 😬 Windows users beware!  You may have to change the surge code in `packages/react-app/package.json` to just `"surge": "surge ./build",`

⚙ If you get a permissions error `yarn surge` again until you get a unique URL, or customize it in the command line.

🚔 Traffic to your url might break the [Infura](https://infura.io/) rate limit, edit your key: `constants.js` in `packages/ract-app/src`.
