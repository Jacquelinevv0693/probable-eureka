## Checkpoint 2: 🏵Your Token 💵

> 👩‍💻 Edit `YourToken.sol` to inherit the **ERC20** token standard from OpenZeppelin
> Mint **1000** (\* 10 \*\* 18) to your frontend address using the `constructor()`.

(Your frontend address is the address in the top right of http://localhost:3000)

> You can `yarn deploy --reset` to deploy your contract until you get it right.

#### 🥅 Goals

- [ ] Can you check the `balanceOf()` your frontend address in the **YourToken** of the `Debug Contracts` tab?
- [ ] Can you `transfer()` your token to another account and check _that_ account's `balanceOf`?

(Use an incognito window to create a new address and try sending to that new address. Use the `transfer()` function in the `Debug Contracts` tab.)
