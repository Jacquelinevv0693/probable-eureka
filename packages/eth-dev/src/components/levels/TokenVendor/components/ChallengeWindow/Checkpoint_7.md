## Checkpoint 7: 📜 Contract Verification

Update the `api-key` in `packages/hardhat/package.json`. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

> Now you are ready to run the `yarn verify --network your_network` command to verify your contracts on etherscan 🛰

👀 You may see an address for both YouToken and Vendor.  You will want the Vendor address.

👉 This will be the URL you submit to 🏃‍♀️[SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com).
