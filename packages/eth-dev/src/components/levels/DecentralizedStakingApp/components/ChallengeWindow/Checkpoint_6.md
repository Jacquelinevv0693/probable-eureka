## Checkpoint 6: 🎚 Frontend 🧘‍♀️

> 📝 Edit the `targetNetwork` in `App.jsx` (in `packages/react-app/src`) to be the public network where you deployed your smart contract.
> 💻 View your frontend at http://localhost:3000/

 👩‍🎤 Take time to craft your user experience...

 📡 When you are ready to ship the frontend app...

 📦  Run `yarn build` to package up your frontend.

💽 Upload your app to surge with `yarn surge` (you could also `yarn s3` or maybe even `yarn ipfs`?)

> 😬 Windows users beware!  You may have to change the surge code in `packages/react-app/package.json` to just `"surge": "surge ./build",`

⚙ If you get a permissions error `yarn surge` again until you get a unique URL, or customize it in the command line.

> 📝 you will use this deploy URL to submit to [SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com).

🚔 Traffic to your url might break the [Infura](https://infura.io/) rate limit, edit your key: `constants.js` in `packages/ract-app/src`.
