## Checkpoint 5: 🚢 Ship it 🚁

📡 Edit the `defaultNetwork` to [your choice of public EVM networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/) in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.js`

👩‍🚀 You will want to run `yarn account` to see if you have a **deployer address**

🔐 If you don't have one, run `yarn generate` to create a mnemonic and save it locally for deploying.

⛽️ You will need to send ETH to your **deployer address** with your wallet.

> 📝 If you plan on submitting this challenge, be sure to set your ```deadline``` to at least ```block.timestamp + 72 hours```
>  🚀 Run `yarn deploy` to deploy your smart contract to a public network (selected in hardhat.config.js)
